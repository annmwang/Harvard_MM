#### ART Timing

- [ ] devise a way for absolute timing for BCID stamp to sector logic
- [ ] plot efficiency vs. BC window

#### ART Spatial Resolution

- [ ] Δx (ART, MM fit projection)
- [ ] Δy using stereo ART strips (and compare with predicted Δy given measured Δx)
- [ ] Δm (ART, MM)
- [ ] efficiency
- [ ] values as a function of N<sub>x</sub>, N<sub>UV</sub>

#### Micromegas

- [ ] Everything from before
- [ ] better μTPC
