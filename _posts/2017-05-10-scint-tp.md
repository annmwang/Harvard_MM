#### TP firmware changes

* The trigger processor has removed the finder packets into the debug stream and replaced them with a timestamp for the scintillator trigger
* The TP is fed the same 40 MHz clock of the MMFE8 boards to align the BC counter of the TP with the BC counter of the MMFE8/GBT packets in the ADDC
* We have a inverter + TTL-to-LVDS converter for the scintillator signal, clock (clock doesn't have an inverter)

#### Layout

* TTL-to-LVDS box is placed in the octuplet area currently to maintain a clean clock input into the TP
* The timing of the scintillator signal was switched to be set by the middle scintillator + PMT array (on top of the octuplet) so that the timing would be good to order ~ns
* The scintillator signal is then clocked in by a 640 MHz clock in the TP FPGA to maintain the best time resolution possible
